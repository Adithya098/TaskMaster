The project involves building a task management web application, "TaskMaster," using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python with Flask, backed by a SQLite database. 
It includes features like CRUD operations, validation, and optional user authentication, along with a Kanban chart where project managers have full access and developers can only change task statuses.
